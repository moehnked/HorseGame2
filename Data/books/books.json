        "The Bodies of all Quadrupeds, as well as men, are composed of different parts which are adapted to their several functions.",
		"Some are solid , as the Bones and cartilages; others are soft, as the Glands and Muscular Flesh; and some are of a middle Nature, as the Ligaments of the joints, and tendons of the muscles.",
		"But whether their particular Structure be loose or solid, or between both, it is very certain that all are made up of small Fibres or Threads. This is so plainly observable in the soft Parts, that it",
        "needs no manner of Proof, since every one must have taken Notice , in tearing Flesh asunder, that it is composed of little Parcels or Bundles , and thefe Parcels may azain be divided into",
        "Others, which are less, and afterwards into Jingle Threads, By which are infinitely smaller than a Hair."
